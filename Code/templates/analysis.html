   <h1> Dropout Rates in Schools in India: An Analysis Drop-Out Ratio Data<br><br></h1>



    <p> Education is the foundation of a prosperous and empowered society. Education plays a vital role in the development of a nation.

High dropout rates are a cause for concern, as they significantly impact students’ prospects. Dropout rates are often linked to socio-economic factors, poverty & lack of access to quality education. Therefore, it is vital to address these underlying issues to reduce dropout rates and ensure that all students have the opportunity to complete their education</p>
