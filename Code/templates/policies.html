Introduced in 2001, SSA is one of India's primary flagship initiatives for ensuring that all children have access to elementary education. Its overarching objectives include ensuring universal access and retention, closing gender and social category inequities in elementary education, and significantly raising children's learning levels.
192 million children in 1.1 million habitations nationwide are served by SSA, which is being implemented in collaboration with State Governments. The SSA goals are to: (a) enroll all children in school, Education Guarantee Centers, or Alternative Schools; (b) keep all children in school until upper primary; (c) close gender and social category gaps in enrollment, retention, and learning; and (d) ensure that learning achievement levels of all students significantly increase.

 KGBVs are upper primary residential schools for Muslim, SC, ST, and OBC females. In places with dispersed housing where schools are far away, KGBVs are built up, posing a threat to the safety of females. Girls are frequently forced to stop their studies because of this. In order to overcome this, KGBV builds residential schools inside the actual block. Adolescent girls who are unable to attend conventional schools are among those who KGBVs assist.
Unable to finish primary school, 10-year-old girls who are not enrolled in school.
Younger females from nomadic communities living in challenging terrain with dispersed habitations who are ineligible for primary or upper elementary schooling.
KGBVs mandate a minimum reservation of 75% of the available seats for students. 

</a><br><br><a href="https://osepa.odisha.gov.in/?p=submenupagecontent&pg=2"  target="_blank"> The National Programme for Education of females at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) </a><br><br>
 which is implemented in educationally disadvantaged blocks (EBB), caters to the requirements of both in- and out-of-school females. Girls who are enrolled in school but do not frequently attend it are also reached out to by NPEGEL.
The need of teachers identifying vulnerable females and giving them extra care to help them overcome their susceptibility and avoid dropping out is emphasized by NPEGEL.Both NPEGEL and KGBV are anticipated to collaborate in order to support SSA's efforts to guarantee the "inclusion" of all girls and their "quality" education. 


</a><br><br><a href="https://pmposhan.education.gov.in/"  target="_blank"> Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS)</a><br><br>
 The National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) was introduced as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 1995 in accordance with the Constitutional Provisions to enhance the level of nutrition of children and enable them to develop in a healthy way. Commonly referred to as MDMS, this program was intended to improve children's nutrition levels while also increasing enrollment, retention, and attendance in school. In 3,479 economically disadvantaged blocks (EBBs), this was extended to upper primary students in classes VI through VIII in 2007, and subsequently it was made universal at the elementary level in 2008. The States/UTs are in charge of carrying out the plan. School Management/Village Education Committees, Panchayati Raj Institutions, and Self-Help Groups oversee and carry out MDMS. currently In MDMS 2010–11, 3.36 crore upper primary school students and 7.18 crore primary school students were both covered by MDMS. The coverage of children in the States of Bihar (43%) UP (57%) and Jharkhand (58%) is less than the national average of 72%, however it is significantly higher in Chhattisgarh (83%) and Odisha (82%) than the national average. The district-level performance of the MDMS in all the States and UTs has been analyzed, and the low-performing districts (144) have been chosen for targeted attention, based on the Annual Work Plan and Budget of the States/UTs for the year 2012–2013. 17 of the districts with low performance are located in LWE-affected regions.


</a><br><br><a href="https://www.education.gov.in/rmsa"  target="_blank">The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan</a><br><br> 
A Centrally sponsored scheme with a funding pattern of 75:25 between Centre and States (90:10 for Special Category and North Eastern States), was launched in 2009–10. The major objectives of the RMSA are to (i) raise the minimum level of education to class X and universalise access to secondary education; (ii) ensure good-quality secondary education with focus on Science, Mathematics and English; and (iii) reduce the gender, social and regional gaps in enrolments, dropouts and improving retention. The interventions supported under RMSA included (i) upgrading of upper primary schools to secondary schools; (ii) strengthening of existing secondary schools; (iii) providing additional classrooms, science laboratories, libraries, computer rooms, art, craft and culture rooms, toilet blocks and water facilities in schools; (iv) providing in-service training of teachers; and (v) providing for major repairs of school buildings and residential quarters for teachers. Despite being launched in the third year of Plan, there was good progress under the RMSA during the Eleventh Plan (Table given below). Against a target of enrolling an additional 3.2 million students, 2.4 million additional students were enrolled in secondary schools during the Eleventh Plan period.


</a><br><br><a href="https://www.education.gov.in/rmsa_integrated"  target="_blank"> Scheme for Setting up of 6000 Model Schools at Block Level</a><br><br> 
The Scheme envisages providing quality education to talented rural children through setting up 6000 model schools as benchmark of excellence at block level at the rate of one school per block. The scheme was launched in 2008-09 and is being implemented from 2009-10. The objectives are:
 To have at least one good quality senior secondary school in every block.
 To have a pace setting role.
 To try out innovative curriculum and pedagogy
 To be a model in infrastructure, curriculum, evaluation and school governance.
The scheme has two modes of implementation, viz., (i) 3500 model schools are to be set up in educationally backward blocks (EBBs) under State/UT Governments; and (ii) the remaining 2500 schools are to be set up under Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode in the blocks which are not educationally backward. Presently, only the component for setting up of 3500 model schools in EBBS under State/UT Governments is operational. The component for setting up of 2500 model schools under PPP mode will be operational in 12th Five Year Plan.


</a><br><br><a href="https://www.education.gov.in/vocationalisation"  target="_blank"> Scheme of Vocationalisation of Secondary Education at +2 level </a><br><br> 
Initiated in 1988, this centrally sponsored scheme of Vocationalisation of Secondary Education provides for diversification of educational opportunities so as to enhance individual employability, reduce the mismatch between demand and supply of skilled manpower and provides an alternative for those pursuing higher education10. Hence, it is important and would be implemented from class IX onwards, unlike the present provision for its implementation from class XI, and would be subsumed under RMSA. Vocational Education courses will be based on national occupation standard brought out by the Sector kill Councils (SSCs) that determine the minimum levels of competencies for various vocations. Academic qualifications would be assessed and certified by educational bodies and vocational skills would be assessed and certified by respective SSCs.In the Twelfth Plan, a mechanism would be created for convergence of vocational courses offered by various ministries, private initiatives and vocational education institutions, and use schools as the outlet for vocational education of young people. A comprehensive repertoire of vocational courses, duration of each course, equipment and facilities, costs and agencies will be developed.

The Scheme of Inclusive Education for Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) has been launched from the year 2009-10. This Scheme replaces the earlier scheme of Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) and would provide assistance for the inclusive education of the disabled children in classes IX-XII.
The aim of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of IEDSS is to enable all students with disabilities, after completing eight years of elementary schooling, to pursue further four years of secondary schooling (classes IX to XII) in an inclusive and enabling environment.
